## Overview

The purpose of this project is to see and analyze the temperature statistics for the sustainability of SurfsUp Shop, focusing on December and June.

The data is collected by running two separate queries for the two months. 

After we run the queries, the data is stored in lists, and after that, is converted to dataframe. 

Once we have the data frame, we are able to get the summary statistics by using the df.describe() method.
